# New Leaderboards and Stats services in PlayFab 

In essence, cross-progression in gaming focuses on providing a seamless and unified gaming experience that respects and
maintains a player's investment in their gaming achievements across different platforms. Ensuring that their progress 
and standing in the gaming community aren't bounded by the limitations of any device or platform.

With this concept in mind, we built the new versions of the Leaderboards and Stats services that can serve as whole solution 
for both tracking and setting up leaderboards, or as separate components.

|Service|Description|
|--|--|
|[Leaderboards](./leaderboards/index.md)| Check who is the best on your game|
|[Stats](./statistics/index.md)| Track every aspect of your game |
