# New Leaderboards and Statistics services

In essence, cross-progression in gaming focuses on providing a seamless and unified gaming experience that respects and
maintains a player's investment in their gaming achievements across different platforms. This behavior ensures that their progress 
and standing in the gaming community aren't bounded by the limitations of any device or platform.
